It went to the White House and Antarctica; it spawned forty thousand offspring and a jet-set generation of collectors; it built bridges within and outside the community. The PHP elephpant is the living symbol of the PHP community, straight from the genius of Vincent Pontier. It is a whole character, running across the world and changing colors all the time. Everybody need elephpant love ! Nowadays, it is alive and kicking. It still reviews my code, casting an odd look to me, once in while. No one can have enough elePHPant."

        talk_title: "PHP ❤️ types"
        talk_description: "PHP is widely known for its dynamic typing features. Still in its latest releases it introduced many features for improving the typing of our applications and many are already planned for future versions. Yet, comparing for example with what Typescript provides for the Javascript ecosystem, many relevant features are still missing from the language. Luckily, in PHP we can emulate features like union types and generics using libraries like Psalm or PHPStan. In this talk we will see how we can use the type system provided by such tools not only to prevent bugs, but also to help us modelling our domain making its invariants explicit in the type system itself. If you are interested in creating safe and reliable software, let's see together how types can help you!"

Then came the TestHook interfaces, but they were inconvenient to use. Now PHPUnit 10 introduces a new event system for developing extensions and for in-depth analysis of your testsuite, hoping to overcome the shortcomings of its predecessors. Join Arne Blankerts, one of the two developers behind PHPUnit's new event system, and learn how easy it can be to extend PHP's popular test runner as well as getting new detailed insights to the test execution."

        talk_title: "Never* use arrays"
        talk_description: "PHP loves its arrays. Arrays are the uber-data structure. They're a list, a map, a stack, a queue, everything in one! Which is the problem. Modern PHP grossly over-uses arrays. In most cases there are better options today, and when you find yourself reaching for 'oh I'll just make this an associative array', stop. An extra 60 seconds of thought and code will often give you a more readable, faster, more memory-efficient, more flexible alternative. Classes, iterables, and collections can and should replace arrays in most of your day to day coding. This talk will go through what PHP arrays actually are (hint: they are not, in fact, arrays at all), why they're so problematic, and what to do instead. By the end, you should find yourself (almost) never reaching for arrays to solve a problem."

Recognising when data would be best handled as time series data (spoiler: events, logs and metrics all work pretty well), and knowing how to adapt your application to work this way can really help. This session introduces time series data concepts, and discusses the situations where the aptly named databases are a useful tool - as well as when they are not! You will learn about handling large data volumes and some of the open source tools available, such as InfluxDB and M3DB. We'll look at examples of implementing time series databases in real world applications, and give resources that you can try out yourself."
